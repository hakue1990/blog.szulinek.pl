## What is Traefik?

Traefik is an open-source, dynamic reverse proxy and load balancer that is often used as a tool for traffic management in containerized environments like Docker. It allows for automatic redirection of network traffic to different services based on configuration rules and supports multiple communication protocols, including HTTP, TCP, and UDP.
